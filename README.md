ComplexStringSplitter
=====================

This is more functional string splitter. It can deal with that the delimiter appears in the string content.
For example

"desk","desk is small, please change it ","ok"

the comma appears in the "desk is small ,please change it" when you use split, it will split the content.
this delimiter can solve this problem.

This delimiter is just for comma at first version , you can change it to another delimiter.
